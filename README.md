# K780-Ubuntu-Keymapping


<h3>Function key / Hot Key Switch for Ubuntu + K780 users</h3>

---

Logitech K780 Keyboard replaces function keys(F1-F12) with [hot keys + media keys] by default.

For those who are accustomed to use function keys, it may be a huge inconvenience.

Logitech currently(Aug 2019) does not support any offcial linux application(and perhaps they are not willing to!).

This is to invert from **[Hot keys + Media keys]** to **function keys(F4-F12)** 

* This shell script was tested in **Ubuntu**(can work in other linux versions if they have xmodmap) only
* Function keys inverted are only [F4 to F12] (F1, F2, F3 have not been inverted)

How to use
1. Download [K780_invert_ubuntu.sh]
2. Launch [Startup Applications] in ubuntu
3. Browse [K780_invert_ubuntu.sh] 

All Done!
