# K780-Ubuntu-Keymapping


<h3>Function key / Hot Key Switch for Ubuntu + K780 users</h3>

---

Logitech K780 Keyboard replaces function keys(F1-F12) with [hot keys + media keys] by default.</br>
For those who are accustomed to use function keys, it may be a huge inconvenience.</br>
Logitech currently(Aug 2019) does not support any offcial linux application(and perhaps they are not willing to!).</br>

This is to invert from **[Hot keys + Media keys]** to **function keys(F4-F12)** whenever you start up your computer. 

* This shell script was tested in **Ubuntu** (18.04) only
* May work in other linux versions if they have xmodmap
* Function keys inverted are only [F4 to F12] **(F1, F2, F3 have not been inverted)**
